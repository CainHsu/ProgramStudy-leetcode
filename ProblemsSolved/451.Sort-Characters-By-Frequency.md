# 451.Sort Characters By Frequency

## Description
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:
```C
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:
```C
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```
Example 3:
```C
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```
## Solution

- 建立哈希映射，记录每个字母出现的次序
- 使用lambda进行排序

## Code
```c++
string frequencySort(string s) {
    if(s.empty()) return s;
    unordered_map<char, int> cnt;
    for(const char& c:s) ++cnt[c];
    sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char &a, char &b){
        return cnt[a] > cnt[b] || cnt[a] == cnt[b] && a < b;
    });
    return s;
}
```
