# 1487.Making File Names Unique

## Description
Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.

Example 1:
```C
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"
```
Example 2:
```C
Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"
```
Example 3:
```C
Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".
```
Example 4:
```C
Input: names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]
Output: ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".
```
Example 5:
```C
Input: names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]
Output: ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]
Explanation: Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it contained the same suffix before.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
- names[i] consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or round brackets.

## Solution

此题需要注意题意

此题可以分为两种情况：哈希中已存在此文件，不存在此文件

比如：`"a(1)", "a(1)", "a", "a"`  
输出应该为：`"a(1)", "a(1)(1)", "a", "a(2)"`

因此，当哈希map中存在a(1)时，首先应查找哈希map中是否存在a(1)(1)，若存在则继续查找a(1)(2)，直到不存在

最后，将此次添加的文件插入哈希map，同时要将此次的a(1)在哈希中的值++，以应对下次输入a的情况

## Code
```c++
vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string>& names) {
    unordered_map<string, int> fileVer;
    vector<string> ans;
    for(const auto &x : names){
        auto iter = fileVer.find(x);
        if(iter == fileVer.end()){
            ans.push_back(x);
            fileVer.insert(make_pair(x, 1));
        }else{
            int ver = iter->second;
            while (fileVer.find(x + "(" + to_string(ver) + ")") != fileVer.end()){
                ver++;
            }
            string name = x + "(" + to_string(ver) + ")";
            fileVer.insert(make_pair(name, 1));
            ++fileVer[x];
            ans.push_back(name);
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
