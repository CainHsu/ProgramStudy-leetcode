# Count and Say

## Description
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```C++
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2, then one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

Example 1:
```c++
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```
## Solution

需要注意的是，length比size大一，因此i+1索引不会越界
使用内置字符串比to_string()快

## Code
```c++
string countAndSay(int n) {
    if(n == 1)
        return "1";
    string data = "123";
    string now = countAndSay(n-1);
    string res = "";
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < now.length(); ++i){
        if(now[i] == now[i+1]) {
            ++count;
            continue;
        }
        else{
            res += data[count];
            count = 0;
            res += now[i];
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
